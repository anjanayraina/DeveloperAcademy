A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a decentralized communications model in which each party (peer) has equivalent capabilities and can initiate communications. This is in contrast to the traditional client-server model, where some computers are dedicated to serving others.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Decentralization**: No central server acts as a single point of failure.
2. **Distributed Ledger**: Every node keeps a copy of the database.
3. **Consensus**: Nodes must agree on the state of the network.

Web3 relies heavily on P2P networks (like Ethereum DevP2P or LibP2P) to broadcast transactions and blocks to all participants without relying on a centralized intermediary.

Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain security. It enables trustless verification and secures assets using mathematical concepts.

### Hash Functions
A cryptographic hash function takes an input (message) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes (digest).
- **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same output.
- **One-way**: You cannot reverse-engineer the input from the hash.
- **Collision Resistant**: It is extremely hard to find two different inputs that produce the same output.
- **Example**: Keccak-256 (used in Ethereum) and SHA-256 (used in Bitcoin).

### Public and Private Keys
Blockchains use asymmetric cryptography:
- **Private Key**: A secret number that allows you to sign transactions and spend funds. Keep it secret!
- **Public Key**: Derived mathematically from the private key; acts as your identity on the network.
- **Address**: A shortened hash of your public key (e.g., `0x71C...`).

An HD Wallet generates a tree structure of keys from a single root seed, which is generated from a human-readable mnemonic seed phrase (typically 12 or 24 words).

### Key Standards:
1. **BIP-39**: Defines the generation of mnemonic phrases and how they map to binary seeds.
2. **BIP-32**: Introduces HD wallet structure, allowing creation of child keys from parent keys.
3. **BIP-44**: Outlines a multi-account hierarchy structure (e.g., `m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`).

A seed phrase can recover your entire wallet and all generated accounts, making recovery simple.

To interact with Web3 applications (DApps), user browsers use Web3 providers supplied by wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rabby.

### Window.ethereum
Wallets inject a global API object at `window.ethereum` into websites. DApps use libraries like **Ethers.js** or **Viem** (often wrapped by **Wagmi** / **RainbowKit**) to interact with it.

### Example connection flow in JS:
```javascript
// Request account access
const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
const userAddress = accounts[0];
```
This enables the DApp to read the user's address and request signatures for transactions.

- $y$: Token balance of Asset B in the liquidity pool.

Welcome to the **{name} Ecosystem Track** on Developer Academy!

### Overview & Architecture
{details['arch']}

### Key Concepts:
1. **Consensus & Execution**: Learn how transactions are validated, ordered, and committed to state.
2. **Network Topology**: Explore mainnet, testnet RPC endpoints, and block explorer verification.
3. **Gas & Execution Efficiency**: Understand execution limits, state storage costs, and transaction fees.

### AI Mentor Assistance:
You can switch to **OpenClaw (Education Mentor)** in the chat panel above to ask questions about {name}'s consensus or architecture at any point!

In this second introductory module, you will configure your developer environment to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts on **{name}**.

### Developer Tooling Chain:
- **Primary Frameworks**: {details['tool']}.
- **RPC & Provider Bindings**: Configure custom network RPC URLs, chain IDs, and testnet faucets.
- **Verification Workflow**: Submit contract source code and ABI artifacts to block explorers.

### AI Mentor Assistance:
If you encounter compiler warnings or deployment errors, switch to **Hermes (Engineering Mentor)** for automated code reviews and fixes!
